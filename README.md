## Note
This project was generated using the standard create-react-app tool from Facebook. As such, the project's structure and some of its files are pre-defined and were not written by us. 
See the src/client folder in particular. Almost all of the files have been modified, and many created, for our custom application, but reportWebVitals.js and setupTests.js, 
and their related code (which is negligible), are two notable exceptions. 

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed (Node.js 16+ recommended for React 18).

Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd src/client
npm install
```
This grabs all the npm packages you'll need for the frontend.

Also install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
All the libraries needed for the backend

**Note:** If you have a virtual environment set up (there's a `venv/` directory), activate it first:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

## Environment Variables

You'll need to set up environment variables:

**For the Flask backend:**
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Your Spotify app client ID
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your Spotify app client secret
- `APP_SECRET_KEY` - A random secret key for session security

Create a `.env` file in the `src/flask-server` directory with these variables.

**For the React client:**
Create a `.env` file in the `src/client` directory with:
```
HOST=127.0.0.1
DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true
```
Best for frontend & backend sync

## Running the App

### Backend (Flask Server)
1. `cd` into `src/flask-server`
2. Run the Flask app with `python3 server.py` or `python3 -m server`
3. The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
4. You can test the login flow by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login`

### Frontend (React Client)
1. `cd` into `src/client`
2. Run `npm start`
3. The React app will start on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

## Usage

To get a working system, you need to run both the frontend and backend at the same time:

1. **Start the Flask backend** (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   cd src/flask-server
   python3 server.py
   ```

2. **Start the React frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd src/client
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
   - Backend: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

**Note:** The frontend and backend are separate applications. The React frontend makes API calls to the Flask backend for Spotify authentication and user data.
